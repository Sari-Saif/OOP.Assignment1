## Assignment 01

The mission is to extend the new functionality of UndoableStringBuilder from [Assignment_00](https://github.com/SariSafe/OOP_HW_00_ARIEL)


The new functionality gives us the option to hold a central UndoableStringBuilder object,

with user that notify when any change was created in the central UndoableStringBuilder.

All of that made by Design Pattern named OBSERVER.
